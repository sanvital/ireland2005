<center><h3>What! You don't like Dublin?</h3></center>
Dublin. OK. I'm not going to launch into a diatribe against Ireland's capital city. I will attempt to do this as matter-of-factly as possible. First, something I read somewhat recently, long after my time in Ireland, which helped crystallize my opinions on Dublin. It is from the opening of John Steinbeck's book <q>Travels With Charley</q>,
<blockquote><tt>
For many years I have traveled in many parts of the world. In America I live in New York, or dip into Chicago or San Francisco. But New York is no more America than Paris is France or London is England.
</tt></blockquote>
I completely agree. I view the big/major/landmark cities as their own category, separate, even, from the areas in the same county/state/country.  So, <b>Dublin is not Ireland</b>, and when I evaluate Dublin as a place to visit (or live, although that pursuit can require different criteria) I compare it to New York City, Paris, San Francisco, Stockholm, Hong Kong, etc.  And, as you might have guessed, I do not rank Dublin very highly amongst its major-metropolitan counterparts.
<p>
There are the basic problems: public transportation (so good in connecting the suburbs) is poor within the city center, bad traffic (seems unavoidable given my first statement), expensive (pretty common in big cities but, still, a bad thing). And then, there is the more difficult to define, and the biggest, problem. Call it the vibe, feeling, or identity of the city. Dublin seems bland, desperate to become <q>cool</q> in the most generic of ways.
<p>
My observations are not unlike that of a magazine article I read while traveling to Ireland. The May 2005 issue of <i>Travel & Leisure</i> had an opinion piece inspired by the adoption of anti-smoking laws throughout Europe. You can read the <a href="../Smoke_Across_the_Water.pdf" target="_blank">full article</a> (PDF format), however, here is the excerpt, written about the whole of Ireland, which I feel is most relevant to Dublin,
<blockquote><tt>
For millennia, Ireland was an ancient and soulful land whose firelit pubs bulged with eccentrics drinking beer, singing songs, writing literature, and dispensing quirky pellets of counterintuitive wisdom. It was classic. <i>&lt;snip&gt;</i> The Ireland of 2005 is a giant strip mall of telemarketing call centers, real estate offices, and glass-fronted wine bars in which the talk is less of blarney than of bling. The romance, the depth, the magic of Ireland has vanished in a puff of non-smoke. The government's own ombudsperson, one Emily O'Reilly, gave a speech last November decrying <q>the vulgar fest that is much of modern Ireland...the staggering drink consumption, the childlike showing off of helicopters and four-wheel drives and private cinemas, the fetishizing of handbags and high heels.</q>
