Eoin was born and raised in Clonmel.  His childhood home is still there, and his parents still live in it.  For a few days, it would be my home-away-from-home.
<p>
We came to Clonmel via Eoin's mom's car, having picked us up in Kilkenny where we had arrived via train from Dublin.
<p>
Eoin's parents were superior hosts.  In fact, Eoin's mom provided us with full-service tours (roundtrip transportation and expert insight) of two nearby historical landmarks:  Cahir Castle and The Rock of Cashel.  The photo at right shows myself and our guide at Cahir Castle.
<p>
I do not have many photos of Clonmel, but it seemed like a cool place to live. Quiet, friendly, and green (yes, it rained there too).
