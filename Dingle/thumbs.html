At some point in its history, this location housed a cobbling business. In its current (and longstanding, I think) role as a pub, someone decided that the shoe paraphernalia (which is everywhere) would not inhibit the serving and drinking of beer and whiskey. And, you know what, they're right."

Now, mind you, this is not hiking on official trails in official parks. Just beautiful scenery and fences that aren't so tall or numerous that you feel all that criminal.<p>This photo is from the start of our first hike, which started at the terminus of a dead-end street at the edge of the harbor."
