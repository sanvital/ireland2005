<blockquote>
<p id=cap>Dingle was my favorite town in Ireland, and pictured here is my favorite pub in Dingle: Dick Mack's. At some point in its history, this location housed a cobbling business. In its current (and longstanding, I think) role as a pub, someone decided that the shoe paraphernalia (which is everywhere) would not inhibit the serving and drinking of beer and whiskey. And, you know what, they're right.</p>
