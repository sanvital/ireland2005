I visited <a href="http://www.wicklow.ie/tourism/attractions/heritage/glendalough.html" target="_top">Glendalough</a> as a day trip from the concrete and crowds of Dublin.  Eoin's sister and her boyfriend (and their car) provided the means for our escape from the city.

Glendalough is part of the <a href="http://www.wicklow.ie/tourism/attractions/wicklow_national_park/" target="_top">Wicklow Mountains National Park</a>.  The beauty of nature, and the bonus of a well-preserved, ancient monastic settlement.  Some of the views looked perfect for a pastoral scene in "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy (especially <a href="glendalough3.jpg" target="fullsize">#3</a>).
