Eoin and I took a bus from Clonmel to spend the day in Waterford. The river, seen in the first photo, appeared to divide the city in half, with the half visible in the photo being the more traditionally interesting part of town. A densely packed downtown full of museums, nice restaurants and shops, etc. Even though I did enjoy a free choral performance at a church located on this side, we eventually split up as I wanted to explore the <i>other</i> side of town.

It was on the other side that I found an abanndoned church surrounded by a neglected graveyard. The third photo could have been taken from some attack-of-the-zombies video game. Remember, aim for the head.
