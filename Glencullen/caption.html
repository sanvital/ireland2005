Returning to Dublin from Glendalough, we made sure to pass through Glencullen and visit <a href="http://www.jfp.ie" target="_top">Johnnie Fox's Pub</a>.  The place promotes itself as the highest pub in Ireland (and one of the oldest), but that is not why I went, loved it, and recommend it.  Yes, they don't shy away from the tourist buck, but, still, it lived up to my hosts' promises of a <i><b>real</b></i> Irish pub.
<p>
The building, the food (especially the "mountain chowder"), the music, and the Guinness.  All great.
